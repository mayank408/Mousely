# Mousely

> A Utility Application made with OpenCV allowing the user to control the cursor with head movements and can perform click events using the blinking of eyes. 

Blinking of left eye corresponds to Left click event.<br />
Blinking of right eye corresponds to Right click event.<br />
Blinking of both the eyes corresponds to Double click event.

Technologies used : OpenCV, Quartz and Dlib 

Currently this application is compatible with OSX only.

## Dependencies Used

1. [Quartz](https://github.com/mayank408/Mousely/edit/master/README.md) : It is used to interact with the operating system and carry out events such as clicking and moving the cursor.

2. [Dlib](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/08/real-time-face-pose-estimation.html) : It is used to detect facial landmarks with high accuracy. Blinking detection in the project is done using this library.

3. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) : It is the Computer vision library which has C/C++, Python, Java interfaces. For this project, I have used OpenCV in Python.



## Installation instructions for OSX

1. Installing Python3 using brew

```
brew install python3
```

2. Installing OpenCV

```
brew install opencv3
```

3. Installing Quartz
```
sudo pip3 install pyobjc-framework-Quartz
sudo pip3 install pyobjc-core
sudo pip3 install pyobjc
```

4. Installing Shape Predictor : Download http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

5. Installing Dlib : The complete instructions step by step for downloading dlib is given [here](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-macos/)

6. Installing Boost and Boost-Python (Required for dlib) : The complete instructions step by step for downloading boost and boost-python is given [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/04/27/installing-boost-and-boost-python-on-osx-with-homebrew/)


## Running the app

Run eye_detection.py providing shape predictor as the argument.

```
python3 eye_detection.py -p res/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat 
```

Demo is available at the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pJwu-km2y708ohy1PWVJtKd2lDEGu_lx/view?usp=sharing).

## Challenges / Todo

1. Improving Accuracy (obviously)
2. Distinguish more clearly between natural blinking of eyes and explicit blinking.
3. Compatibility with Windows.
